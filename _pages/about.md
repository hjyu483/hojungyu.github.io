Bio
======
Hi, I am Hojung Yu, a first-year Master's student in the City and Regional Planning program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently a principal candidate for the *2024 Fulbright Graduate Student Program.* <br>

My research interests focus on *urban visualization and analytics.* I believe data visualization can help citizens develop creative insights or solidify existing ideas, fostering diverse dialogues. Data visualization, in my view, has immense power to bridge citizens' ideas and beliefs. <br>

Before enrolling at Georgia Tech, I studied architecture at Yonsei University. I also worked as an urban planner and designer at Junglim Architecture for three years. With a foundation in urban built environment through architecture and urban design, I am now more interested in examining citizens' behavior and  visualizing interpretations in urban spaces.
