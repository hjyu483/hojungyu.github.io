Bio
======
Hi, I am Hojung Yu, a first-year student in the Master of City and Regional Planning program at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I am currently a principal candidate for the *2024 Fulbright Graduate Student Program.* <br>

My research interests focus on *urban visualization and analytics.* Data visualization can help citizens develop creative insights or solidify existing ideas, fostering diverse dialogues. I believe design tools have immense power to bridge citizens' ideas and beliefs.<br>

Before enrolling at Georgia Tech, I studied architecture at Yonsei University. I also worked as an urban planner and designer at [Junglim Architecture](http://www.junglim.com/) for three years. With a strong understanding of how urban settings influence human behavior, I am now more interested in examining how citizens interpret cities.
