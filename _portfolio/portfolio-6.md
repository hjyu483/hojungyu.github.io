The old downtown of Gwangyang was a village that dates back to the Joseon Dynasty, but over time, the area has aged, particularly with the development of a new city nearby. This decline has been exacerbated by a shrinking population and a rise in vacant houses. To combat neighborhood deterioration, Gwangyang City aimed to promote rural tourism as a revitalization strategy. This workshop was one of the city’s initiatives to rejuvenate the historic city center.

In Gwangyang, we engaged with residents and identified three key elements: natural walls, alleys, and the city’s scenic views. Gwangyang features walls dating back to the Joseon Dynasty and alleys that evolved organically over time. We envisioned these alleys as spaces where everyday life unfolds—where neighbors pass by, greet one another, discuss current events, or where an elderly resident might pause to rest.

To capture this vision, we designed a pavilion that combines the qualities of a wall and a bench, embodying the unique character of Gwangyang and visualizing its identity.
