With a population of 2,746,388 as of the 2020 census, Chicago is a major urban center. In this assignment, my focus was to map obesity rates, vacancy rates, and hospital locations and help provide some hypotheses through mapping. The data were sourced from ArcGIS Online, Chicago Data Portal and Chicago Government.<br>
Thematic colors represent each countyâ€™s obesity levels. Black dots denote vacancy rates, revealing that southern and eastern areas with high obesity levels also tend to have more vacant houses. Cross symbols mark the locations of hospitals. A 3D bivariate map illustrates poverty and disability in Chicago. Here, poverty is represented by elevation, while disability levels are shown with graduated colors. Taller columns indicate lower poverty levels, and a shift toward red tones reflects higher disability rates. <br>

From this map, we can propose three hypotheses:
1. Obesity rates are highly correlated with poverty levels.
2. Hospital locations show minimal association with poverty; however, this requires further analysis.
3. There may exist a relationship between vacancy rates and obesity levels.
