With a population of 2,746,388 as of the 2020 census, Chicago is a major urban center. In this assignment, my focus was to map obesity rates, vacancy rates, and hospital locations and help provide some hypotheses through mapping. The data were sourced from ArcGIS Online, Chicago Data Portal and Chicago Government.<br>
This spatial analysis of Chicago suggests several key relationships among obesity rates, vacancy rates, and hospital distribution. Higher obesity levels correlate with increased vacancy rates, particularly in the southern and eastern areas, potentially linking these factors with socioeconomic challenges. Despite these disparities, hospital locations are fairly accessible along main roads, indicating a relatively equitable distribution of healthcare access. Furthermore, the relationship between poverty and disability rates highlights areas where social and health interventions may be most needed. These findings underscore the interconnectedness of health, housing, and socioeconomic conditions in urban environments and suggest pathways for targeted community support and revitalization efforts. <br>
