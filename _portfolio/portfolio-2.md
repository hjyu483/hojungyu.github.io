Chicago, the third-largest city in the United States, is renowned for its rich history, diverse culture, and architectural innovation. With a population of 2,746,388 as of the 2020 census, Chicago is a major urban center. In this assignment, my focus was to map obesity rates, vacancy rates, and hospital locations and make some hypotheses through this. <br>
Thematic colors represent each countyâ€™s obesity levels. I selected the color red to evoke awareness of this health issue, using graduated colors to indicate varying levels of obesity across regions. <br>
BBlack dots denote vacancy rates, revealing that southern and eastern areas with high obesity levels also tend to have more vacant houses. This suggests a potential link to slum conditions in these communities, indicating a close association between obesity, vacancy rates, and poverty levels. <br>
Cross symbols mark the locations of hospitals, which are generally well-distributed across Chicago. Thus, hospital proximity appears equitable across communities. <br>
A 3D bivariate map illustrates poverty and disability in Chicago. Here, poverty is represented by elevation, while disability levels are shown with graduated colors. Taller columns indicate lower poverty levels, and a shift toward red tones reflects higher disability rates. <br>
By linking the 2D and 3D maps, we can propose three hypotheses:
1. Obesity rates are highly correlated with poverty levels.
2. Hospital locations show minimal association with poverty; however, this requires further analysis, possibly through regression.
3. There may be a positive relationship between vacancy rates and obesity levels.
