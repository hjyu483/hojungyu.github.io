As virtual spaces increasingly fulfill the roles of physical spaces, we must reconsider the abandoned functions of real-world spaces. How can these empty spaces be reactivated with new activities? The Yongsan Game Market, with its 40-year history, is gradually declining and being replaced by housing and work-related programs. However, what is at stake is the market's original vibrancy and the sense of community created by its game-centered commerce.

Is it possible to bridge the gap between public and commercial spaces? By proposing a new game center, I explored the potential for coexistence between virtual and physical spaces. Through the dynamic tension between these two realms, I hope to revive the public space that has been overshadowed by the virtual one.
