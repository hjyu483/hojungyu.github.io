The Young Architects Fellowship program is an annual research program for young architects. Our research focused on Buiksloterham Urban Renewal Masterplan, analyzing how the concept a *circular city* was realized in this visionary plan. Through qualitative research-including desk review, site visits and interviews-we observed the relationship between existing land conditions and design guidelines, exploring how innovative sustainable approaches can contribute to soil remediation and land reuse.
Additionally, this ambitious plan could not have succeeded without active public engagement from the outset. De Ceuvel, a pilot project planned by public officials and then operated by private associations, along with Schoonship, an experimental circular neighborhood, served as sources of inspiration for the development of Buiksloterham's circular city concept.
