The Young Architects Fellowship program included an overseas field research trip, during which we investigated the soil-regeneration master plan in Buiksloterham, particularly focusing on the De Ceuvel area. Buiksloterham had been used for industrial purposes for about 100 years before being reclaimed and left vacant. Our research involved a desk review and interviews with stakeholders involved in the Buiksloterham project.

Through this investigation, we observed how the pilot projectâ€™s soil purification concept evolved into a comprehensive master plan. Using insights gained from this study, we proposed an advanced architectural concept. We explored the relationship between existing land conditions and architecture from the perspective of sustainable soil ecosystems, considering how architectural approaches can contribute to sustainable soil remediation and reuse.

Examining soil regeneration from a sectional perspective offered new possibilities for reimagining the use of contaminated sites, allowing for the co-existence of social activities and environmental restoration.
