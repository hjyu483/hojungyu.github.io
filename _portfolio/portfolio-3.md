The Uiwang-Gunpo-Ansan area is a newly planned city in Gyeonggi Province, designed as a third-generation new town with a target population of 94,000. The objectives for this development are to establish a future-oriented, transit-centered innovative city where various key functions are interconnected, to preserve the beautiful natural environment, to create attractive urban spaces, and to foster a city that promotes synergy with surrounding areas.

The plan centers on high-density development around transit hubs, particularly around Uiwang Station and Banwol Station. This area, featuring a "Complete Street" at its core, is designated as a specialized zone aimed at revitalizing the region through three-dimensional mixed-use development. To support Transit-Oriented Development, the design integrates building and pedestrian environments around transit stations, creating key walkable spaces for the community.
