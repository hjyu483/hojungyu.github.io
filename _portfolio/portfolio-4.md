The Asan Tangjeong 2 Master Plan is a new city development adjacent to the Samsung Display plant and the KTX station, which provides a high-speed rail connection to Seoul. This city is designed to integrate housing, commerce, business, and industry with its surrounding context. Key design principles included walkability, connectivity, and urban complexity, with particular attention to enhancing walkability along the main river. Building height, function, and form are regulated to support these goals.

The plan includes three primary streets that connect different areas, alongside pedestrian-only streets that link individual plots. Three central zones were designed as mixed-use areas to attract people and promote urban vitality. I contributed to this project from the competition phase through to the planning stage, primarily by creating visualizations for reports and concept design documents to facilitate communication with the municipality. Additionally, I worked on urban design elements and established architectural guidelines based on our design concepts. This master plan is an ongoing project, scheduled for completion in 2026.
