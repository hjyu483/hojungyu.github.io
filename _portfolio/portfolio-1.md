The initial question was: *"How many years would it take to buy a single house?"* <br>
To address housing disparities, I created a housing affordability index, enabling users to observe these inequalities more clearly. This analysis was conducted at the county level, using median household income and median housing value to calculate the index. The housing affordability index was derived by dividing the median housing value by the median household income. <br>
The Housing Affordability Index provides an intuitive understanding of spatial and economic differences in housing affordability. By combining median wage and median housing values, users can better grasp geographic inequality and disparity compared to examining each variable independently. <br>
By pairing the main map with a scatter plot, users can utilize brushing and linking to gain further insights. This approach allows users to quickly identify which counties are unaffordable within the scatter plot. Given that larger areas may be overemphasized on the map, additional scatter plots can provide valuable spatial understanding.


[Housing Affordability Map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hojung.yu/viz/HousingAffordabilityMap_17280173108570/Dashboard1?publish=yes) was created using Tableau Software, with data cleaned in R.
