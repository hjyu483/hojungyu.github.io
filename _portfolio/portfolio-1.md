The initial question was: *"How many years should be take to buy a single house?"* <br>
To address this, I created a housing affordability index, allowing users to observe housing disparities. The analysis was conducted at the county level, using median household income and median housing value to calculate the index. The housing affordability index was simply created by dividing the median housing value by the median income.
This index allows people to intuitively understand the spatial and economic differences in housing affordability. Users can also link a scatter plot to the main map to easily identify which counties are unaffordable to live.

[Housing Affordability Map](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/hojung.yu/viz/HousingAffordabilityMap_17280173108570/Dashboard1?publish=yes) was created by Tableau Software and the data was cleaned by R.
